This policy explains how we do that.\_\n\n**2. WHAT ARE COOKIES?**\_\n\nCookies are small text files a website may put on your computer or mobile device when you first visit a site or page. The cookie helps that website, or another website, recognize your device the next time you visit. Web beacons or other similar files do the same thing. We use the term “cookies” in our terms and conditions to refer to all files that collect information in this way. Cookies can serve many functions. For example, they may help us remember your username and preferences, analyse how well our website is performing, or even allow us to recommend content we believe will be most relevant to you.\_\n\nCertain cookies contain personal information. For example, if you select “remember me” when logging in, a cookie will store your username. Most cookies won’t collect information that identifies you personally and will instead collect more general information such as how you arrive at and use our websites or your general location.\_\n\nIf you would like to check or change the types of cookies your system accepts, this can usually be altered within your browser settings. You can block cookies at any time by activating the setting on your browser that allows you to refuse the setting of all or some cookies. By not blocking cookies and continuing to browse, you are authorising the use of cookies. If you use your browser settings to block all cookies (including essential cookies) you may not be able to access all parts of our website.\_\n\n**3. WHAT SORT OF COOKIES DOES DECISION TREE TECHNOLOGY USE?**\_\n\nWe use cookies to track your use of our website. This enables us to understand how you use the site and track any patterns of usage. This helps us to develop and improve our website and identify products or services you might like.\_\n\n**4. GENERALLY, COOKIES ARE IN THE FOLLOWING CATEGORIES:**\_\n\n**Essential Cookies.** Some cookies are essential for the operation of our website. For example, some cookies allow us to identify subscribers and ensure they can access the subscription-only pages. If a subscriber opts to disable these cookies, they will not be able to access all the content to which their subscription entitles them.\_\n\n**Performance Cookies.** We use other cookies to analyse how our visitors use our websites and to monitor website performance. This allows us to provide a high-quality experience by customizing our offerings and quickly identifying and fixing any issues that arise. For example, we might use performance cookies to keep track of which pages are most popular, which method of linking between pages is most effective, and to determine why some pages are receiving error messages. We might also use these cookies to highlight articles or site services that we think will be of interest to you based on your use of the website.\_\n\n**Functionality Cookies.** We use functionality cookies to allow us to remember your preferences. For example, cookies save you the trouble of typing in your username every time you access the site. Cookies recall your customization preferences, such as which regional edition of the website you want to see when you log in. We also use functionality cookies to provide you with enhanced services such as allowing you to watch a video online or comment on a blog.\_\n\n**Behaviourally Targeted Advertising Cookies.** Decision Tree Technology and advertisers may use cookies to serve you with advertisements that we believe are relevant to you and your interests. For example, if you read a number of articles about marketing on Decision Tree Technology or on other sites, a pay per click advertising company might infer you are interested in this topic and serve you with its advertisements for PPC advertising. You might see advertisements like that on other sites you visit. These cookies do not, however, tell our advertisers who you are.\_\n\n**5. COOKIES CAN ALSO BE:**\_\n\n**Session Cookies.** These are only stored on your device during your web session and are automatically deleted when you close your browser. For example, there may be a session ID set that allows you to browse our website without having to log in to each individual page.\_\n\n**Persistent Cookies.** A persistent cookie is stored on your device and remains there when you close your web browser. For example, we may use a cookie to remember your log-in information. The cookie is set by our website when you indicate you would like your user information remembered and is read by our website the next time you visit our website.\_\n\n**6. DOES ANYONE ELSE USE COOKIES ON DECISION TREE TECHNOLOGY WEBSITES?**\_\n\nWe don’t currently enable automated advertising on our website. Advertisers sometimes use their own cookies to provide you with targeted advertising. For example, advertisers may use a profile they have built on sites you have previously visited to present you with more relevant advertisements during your visit to Decision Tree Technology if we allowed automated advertising. We believe our users prefer to see advertisements that are more relevant to their interests.\_\n\nWe also use or allow third parties to serve cookies that fall into the categories above. For example, like many companies, we use Google Analytics to help us monitor our website traffic. We may also use third party cookies to help us with market research, revenue tracking, improving site functionality, and monitoring compliance with our terms and conditions.\_\n\n**7. CAN YOU BLOCK COOKIES?**\_\n\nYou can set your browser to not accept cookies however If you choose to disable cookies, you may find that certain sections of our online services do not work properly.\_\n\nCookies help you to get the most out of our online services. The first time you accessed our website you should have seen pop-up or an overlay explaining that by continuing to access our site you are consenting to our use of cookies and also recommending you ‘whitelist’ our email contact details. If you re-set your cookie setting or clear your browser history, that message should pop-up again.\_\n\n**8. DO WE TRACK WHETHER YOU OPEN OUR EMAILS?**\_\n\nOur emails may contain a campaign-unique “web beacon pixel” to tell us whether our emails are opened and to verify any click-throughs to links or advertisements within the email. We may use this information for purposes including to determine which of our emails are more interesting to users, to query whether users who do not open our emails wish to continue receiving them, and to inform our advertisers (in aggregate) how many users have clicked on their advertisements. The web beacon pixel is deleted when you delete the email. If you do not wish the pixel to be downloaded to your device, you can elect to receive emails from us in plain text rather than HTML.\n\n\n\n"
